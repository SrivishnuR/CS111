lab1a.c - 
Initially the current terminal settings are extracted from STDIN, modified,
and then set. Without the SHELL choice, we have a simple readWrite function
that reads from STDIN and echoes the input. 

If SHELL is specified, two pipes are opened. One for transmitting data
to the shell, and one for retreiving data from it. A child process is opened 
for the shell and the stdin, stdout, and stderr are all set to the corresponding
pipes. The parent process then gets data from the keyboard, modifies it accordingly,
and pipes it to the shell. After this the output results are piped back to the parent
process, modified, and then sent to stdout. This is all done with the poll function, 
which waits until input or output from shell is detected. If ctrl-C or ctrl-D is pressed
then the process either kills the shell or closes the pipe to write to shell.

All that was used was the function man pages for this project. I had some issues with the 
sanity check script but that was solved after I re downloaded the script.
