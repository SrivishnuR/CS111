lab3a.c -
File that goes through an ext2 file system and prints out information. 
This program only supports one group as the TA specified that was all that was necessary. 
However, it does support a variable block size. Initially it prints out the superblock and 
singular group info. After that loops through and prints out the free blocks and free inodes. 
This part was fairly simple. 
Printing out inode information was still not too difficult. The hardest part was parsing the 
time information. 
With directory information, I assumed the linked list structure would automatically end in a 
null node with an INODE field of 0. This was a wrong assumption to make. The program started
working once I instead iterated through the blocks and indirect blocks of the directory. 
While I do not have a way to test the indirect blocks for the directory entry as that would 
need a file system with an incredibly large amount of directories, I believe my logic is correct 
and it should work.
The indirect entries were fairly simple once I got the indirect blocks of the directories down. 
However, I wrongly assumed that if the single indirect block wasn't allocated, this automatically
meant the second and third indirect blocks wouldn't be allocated as well. Another mistake I made is 
that I assumed in an indirect entry block that consecutive entries would always be allocated and 
once you hit an entry that ended in 0 it implied that there where no other blocks for the file left. 
This assumption was also wrong and once I corrected it the program worked as supposed to.

Makefile -
Very simple 
default: compiles lab3a.c with -Wall and -Wextra
dist: creates tar of lab3a.c, README, and Makefile
clean: removes the tar and lab3a executable
