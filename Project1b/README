lab1b-client.c - 
Initially the current terminal settings are extracted from STDIN, modified,
and then set. The options are then extracted. And we attempt to connect to the server.

Once we do that, if a key is supplied, we load mcrypt to be used for encryption and decryption.
We then poll for input from keyboard, encrypt it based on the file supplied and then sent to the server.
We also poll for output from the server, decrypt it, and send it to stdout.
If the server exits, we poll for POLLRDHUP to break from the loop.
We also have a log option that logs the encrypted input and the pre decrypted output. 

lab1b-server.c -
We first extract the options and open a socket for connection. Once we connect, we create pipes to and from
the shell and create a child process that runs the shell. 
The main process then polls for data from the 
client and decrypts it based on the file supplied and then sends that to the shell.
The shell output is then encrypted and sent back to the client.
All the while we watch for ctrlC and ctrlD and sigpipe from the shell for exit conditions.
When we exit we close the sockets to let the client recieve the POLLRDHUP error.
