lab4b.c -
This program first processes the inputs, then intializes the sensors. 
After that it loops indefinitely outputting the timestamp and temperature
gotten from the temperature sensor at a user defined interval. Input is 
polled for from stdin and processed for commands. Finally if the OFF command
is sent or if the button is pressed, the program deinitializes the sensors
and ends.

Makefile -
default: builds the program using the -Wall and -Wextra options along with
the -lmraa library for the sensors and the -lm library for the log function.

clean: gets rid of the executable and tar

check: runs smoketest.sh

dist: makes a tar of the README, Makefile, and lab4b.c

smoketest.sh - 
Runs a smoketest. Tests to see if the program accepts all the arguments
and then checks to see if it takes all the options and logs them correctly
