lab4c-tcp.c -
This program does the exact same as lab4b except it gets input from a server
and sends output back to the server.

lab4c-tls.c -
This program does the same thing as lab4c-tcp.c except it also establishes a 
secure tls connection to the server before sending and recieving data.

Makefile -
default: builds the program using the -Wall and -Wextra options along with
the -lmraa library for the sensors and the -lm library for the log function.

For tls also uses the -lssl and -lcrypto libraries

clean: gets rid of the executables and tar

dist: makes a tar of the README, Makefile, lab4c-tls.c, and lab4c-tcp.c
